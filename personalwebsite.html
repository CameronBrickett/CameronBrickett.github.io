My name is Cameron Brickett and this is my programming portfolio. This is my webpage that contains all of my code I have written so far for my CSC 106 class.<br>
    I am writing this code in html documents.  The app link will take you to the programs that I have written that will work on phones.  
    The javascript tab is for the programs that I have written that will be embeddeed on websites.
